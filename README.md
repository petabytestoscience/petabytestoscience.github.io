## About this workshop series

The [Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy](https://www.aura-astronomy.org/) (AURA) is organizing a series of workshops on “Petabytes to Science”, supported by [The Kavli Foundation](https://www.kavlifoundation.org/). 
These workshops aim to identify the highest priority technologies and capabilities required for a broad-based user community to take full scientific advantage of the opportunities in data-intensive astronomy being created by the [Large Synoptic Survey Telescope](https://www.lsst.org/) (LSST), the [Wide Field Infrared Space Telescope](https://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/) (WFIRST), and other massive survey facilities. We also looked at the implications for the workforce, education and public outreach.

### Workshop 1 - July 2018 (Chicago)

The first Kavli Petabytes to Science workshop engaged a small group of domain experts on the resources necessary to maximize the scientific returns of the large volume and high-complexity datasets to be produced by AURA observatories in the coming decades. 

### Workshop 2 - February 2019 (Las Vegas)

The second workshop was held February 12-14, 2019 in Las Vegas, NV. The aim of this workshop was to discuss important trends and technologies for data intensive astronomy, especially with LSST and WFIRST, and to formulate potential white papers. With a holistic approach, the approximately 30 participants built a single document encompassing several broad categories; this document will be made publicly available in April 2019. 

### Workshop 3 - October 2019 (Boston)

The third workshop will be held in Boston, 22-24 October 2019.
