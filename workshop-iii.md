The provisional agenda is now available [here &rarr;](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vR2bv9QNpNBPysLJ0he_F_N5p7nUOR5terztxwOiOkPGt5KLE-Qobcj_nk2A2lvdYN0K8sJeCPKRByM/pubhtml?gid=0&single=true)

In the 2020s, astronomers will be faced with the task of interpreting vast quantities of data from the LSST and other large open data survey missions such as WFIRST. The challenge for any individual or research group working at the petabyte scale are significant, the challenges of making it possible for any astronomer to work with these data are immense.

The third meeting in a [series on this topic](/), this community workshop is designed to gather a broad collection of astronomers, educators, and engineers to discuss the technical, institutional, and sociological barriers preventing any astronomer leveraging the scientific potential of these petabyte-scale datasets, and to develop a community roadmap designed to address these challenges and enable a [data inclusion revolution in astronomy](https://astrosociety.org/news-publications/astrobeat.html) (article made available courtesy of ASP).

### Who this workshop is for

This workshop is for individuals who want to initiate change in the astrophysics community to enable science in the petabyte era. While this meeting isn't targeted at a single scientific field or question, some examples of challenges we might address at this meeting include:

- By what method can we distribute resources, access, and systems to harness the world’s skills to follow up transients at high speed in the 2020s? What technological and sociological solutions would maximize our understanding of the transient universe by 2030?
- Simulations and synthetic data are becoming more and more important for precision inference on petabyte observational data sets. How can we federate these large, unruly, ephemeral data sets to maximize global inclusion?
- How do we make it possible for any astronomer to combine multiple petabyte-scale imaging datasets and build flexible metadata products that can describe systems as dense as star clusters and as diffuse as intra-cluster light? What does a flexible architecture look like that can support the broadest diversity of astronomical sources?

### Workshop format

The workshop will be structured around a number of key 'challenges' (see above), with topics covering the key themes of [this document this document from Workshop II](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05116) (Data Management, Technology & Infrastructure, Software, Analysis Methods: Algorithms and Statistical Foundations, Workforce & Career Development, Education and Public Outreach). Participants will be expected to have read this document before attending the workshop (or at least the sections most relevant to their interests).

The meeting will be a combination of plenary sessions, afternoon 'un-conference' breakout sessions, and a hack day.

### What are the goals of this meeting?

The main goals for this workshop are:

- To gather feedback on the ideas discussed in [this document](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.05116) and to refine specific challenges/needs in each area.
- To develop community-based networks and support for a ‘data inclusion revolution’ in astronomy.
- To produce a small collection of roadmaps/action plans for each of the main challenges that includes deliverables, resource estimates, priorities, and to establish ongoing working groups motivated to address these challenges.
- Provide actionable input to major astronomy user facilities.
